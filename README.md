# Image-Classification-projecsts-on-Spices

Image classification is the process of a computer accurately predicting the class an image falls under. It will calculate the probability of an image being part of a particular class, such as 'cat' or 'dog', returning the most likely class as a prediction.

In this repository we create a Image classification on multiple spices and their respective adulterants.

## Basics steps for Building Image Classification Project
* Step-1) Explore the Dataset.
* Step-2 Split Dataset into train, test and validation.
* Step-3) Build a CNN model.
* Step-4) Train and Validate the Model.
* Step-5) Test the Model.
* Step-6) Save the Model.
